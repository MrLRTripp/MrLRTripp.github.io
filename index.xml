With the advancements in natural language processing, chatbots have become more human-like in their responses, making them an attractive tool for businesses and organizations to communicate with customers. However, there is a new development in the world of chatbots that has raised concerns: intentionally biased chatbots.
The concern is not about the AI chatbots that are deliberately designed by nefarious actors to spread misinformation and propaganda - although they will surely use AI to supercharge their current bots.</description></item><item><title>AI Job Disruption</title><link>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/social_impact/person_using_ai/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 17:13:18 -0900</pubDate><guid>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/social_impact/person_using_ai/</guid><description>AI won&amp;rsquo;t take your job. A person using AI will. AI chatbots such as OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT, Microsoft&amp;rsquo;s Bing chatbot, and soon-to-be-released Google&amp;rsquo;s Bard will disrupt knowledge worker jobs much like the internet and smartphone did before. No, some chatbot is not going to displace you and make your role unnecessary (at least not yet). The big concern for you right now is that someone else in your office, a competitor down the street, or a competitor on the other side of the world is moving at warp speed to use AI chatbots as a force multiplier.</description></item><item><title>How to Reach Your Target Audience in 1 Simple Step</title><link>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/target_audience/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Mar 2023 11:33:21 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/target_audience/</guid><description>Create targeted messages with a simple prompt If you have been following my blog, you know that AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Bing remember the context of the chat session so making adjustments to the response from the chatbot is easy as following up with a simple prompt. As you well know, creating messages that are aimed at a specific target audience is important because it can increase customer engagement, revenue, loyalty, and satisfaction.</description></item><item><title>Change the tone with a prompt</title><link>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/change_tone/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Feb 2023 10:24:44 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/change_tone/</guid><description>Change the tone AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing make it simple to change the tone of your message. Recall that the tone of a message is the attitude that a writer expresses towards a subject or topic to their reader. It can be delivered in different ways, such as through word choice, punctuation, and sentence structure. Tone always sends a message and it affects how the reader will perceive it.</description></item><item><title>Translations with just a prompt</title><link>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/translations/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Feb 2023 18:05:12 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/translations/</guid><description>Translate your message to 100 languages The previous post showed how you can generate some very nice thank-you notes as long as you use a detailed prompt. You also saw how the AI chatbot can remember context so you can adjust a previous response by creating a new prompt with just the changes you want. For instance, let&amp;rsquo;s translate the thank-you note to Spanish.
Here is the thank-you note in English this time generated by ChatGPT:</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT Needs Prompt Engineering</title><link>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/prompt_engineering/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Feb 2023 13:49:06 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/prompt_engineering/</guid><description>A good response requires a good prompt The term &amp;ldquo;Prompt Engineer&amp;rdquo; is starting to pop up as a person that crafts prompts for ChatGPT and other AI assistants. &amp;ldquo;But wait a minute,&amp;rdquo; you say, &amp;ldquo;wasn&amp;rsquo;t the AI assistant supposed to make it easy for everyone to take advantage of its superior language capabilities?&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Now I&amp;rsquo;m supposed to engineer prompts?&amp;rdquo; Well, yes and no. There are two basic approaches that I have used to get the AI assistant to generate the desired response: 1.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT and Real Estate: A Self-assessment</title><link>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/chatgpt_introspection/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Feb 2023 17:36:34 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/real_estate_llms/chatgpt_introspection/</guid><description>Self-assessment Before I begin to experiment with engineering prompts for specific tasks, let&amp;rsquo;s have ChatGPT perform a self-assessment of its capabilities in the areas of Real Estate Analytics, Mortgages, and helping Real Estate Agents. After all, a good performance assessment of a human team member begins with a self-assessment.
I think the response is pretty compelling, but we need to verify its capabilities with specifically engineered prompts and chat sessions.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT for Real Estate: Can't live with it.

A surge of activity has occurred in technical forums, mainstream news sites, and social media platforms. Rather than repeating the broad capabilities of ChatGPT, let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at how AI tools such as ChatGPT may be utilized for Real Estate Analytics, Mortgages, and helping Real Estate Agents. Why real estate and finance? These are huge industries that impact the daily lives of just about everyone and often require a personal touch.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT is improving scammers' text messages</title><link>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/scammer/scammer_text/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 19:16:09 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/scammer/scammer_text/</guid><description>Improving scammers&amp;rsquo; text messages As with many powerful tools, ChatGPT can be used for illicit purposes. In this case, ChatGPT can be used to correct grammar, punctuation and misspellings in a scammer&amp;rsquo;s text message and rephrase it to read as if it came from a legitimate source. As we have been taught, poor grammar, punctuation and misspellings are often clues that a text message did not come from a legitimate source.</description></item><item><title>Head of Investment Banking Emirates Investment Bank?!?!</title><link>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/scammer/scammer_email/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 18:17:09 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/scammer/scammer_email/</guid><description>More than just improving language ChatGPT can also enable scammers to create emails that seem more genuine and trustworthy. Again, it is not that difficult to spot that it is a scam, but improving the language used in a scam email is just one of the ways Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist scammers. The human-like responses and the ability to understand context means that bots powered by LLMs can carry on a conversation over several text or email exchanges which can build trust before the infected doc or link is sent.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT vs Bing: Rewrite scam text</title><link>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/scammer/chatgpt_vs_bing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 10:56:37 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://mrlrtripp.com/article/scammer/chatgpt_vs_bing/</guid><description>Who does it better? Microsoft has a preview version of Bing that just got a lot smarter with its own version of ChatGPT. Now you can chat with Bing and get answers in natural language. Let&amp;rsquo;s compare how Bing and OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT performed when revising a scammer&amp;rsquo;s text.
Both revisions are much better than the original, but I prefer the ChatGPT revision; it uses a friendlier tone.

ChatGPT is a text generator that can converse with humans on various topics, using natural language and common sense. It is based on GPT-3, one of the largest and most powerful language models ever created. ChatGPT can answer questions, tell jokes, write stories, and even generate code or lyrics.</description></item></channel></rss>
