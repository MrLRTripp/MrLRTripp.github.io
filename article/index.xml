A surge of activity has occurred in technical forums, mainstream news sites, and social media platforms. Rather than repeating the broad capabilities of ChatGPT, let&amp;rsquo;s take a closer look at how AI tools such as ChatGPT may be utilized for Real Estate Analytics, Mortgages, and helping Real Estate Agents. Why real estate and finance? These are huge industries that impact the daily lives of just about everyone and often require a personal touch.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT is improving scammers' text messages</title><link>https://MrLRTripp.github.io/article/scammer/scammer_text/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 19:16:09 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://MrLRTripp.github.io/article/scammer/scammer_text/</guid><description>Improving scammers&amp;rsquo; text messages As with many powerful tools, ChatGPT can be used for illicit purposes. In this case, ChatGPT can be used to correct grammar, punctuation and misspellings in a scammer&amp;rsquo;s text message and rephrase it to read as if it came from a legitimate source. As we have been taught, poor grammar, punctuation and misspellings are often clues that a text message did not come from a legitimate source.</description></item><item><title>Head of Investment Banking Emirates Investment Bank?!?!</title><link>https://MrLRTripp.github.io/article/scammer/scammer_email/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Feb 2023 18:17:09 -0800</pubDate><guid>https://MrLRTripp.github.io/article/scammer/scammer_email/</guid><description>More than just improving language ChatGPT can also enable scammers to create emails that seem more genuine and trustworthy. Again, it is not that difficult to spot that it is a scam, but improving the language used in a scam email is just one of the ways Large Language Models (LLMs) can assist scammers.

Microsoft has a preview version of Bing that just got a lot smarter with its own version of ChatGPT. Now you can chat with Bing and get answers in natural language. Let&amp;rsquo;s compare how Bing and OpenAI&amp;rsquo;s ChatGPT performed when revising a scammer&amp;rsquo;s text.
Both revisions are much better than the original, but I prefer the ChatGPT revision; it uses a friendlier tone.

ChatGPT is a text generator that can converse with humans on various topics, using natural language and common sense. It is based on GPT-3, one of the largest and most powerful language models ever created. ChatGPT can answer questions, tell jokes, write stories, and even generate code or lyrics.</description></item></channel></rss>
