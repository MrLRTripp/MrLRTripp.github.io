# Keep your bot fenced in

Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives, and it is impossible to imagine functioning without it. From smartphones to social media, from virtual assistants to AI-powered chatbots, we trust technology to make our lives easier and more efficient. However, when it comes to complex technologies like AI-powered chatbots, it's important to acknowledge that trust should have its limits.  

The benefits of Large Language Model (LLM) AI chatbots, such as ChatGPT, cannot be denied. They can provide us with immediate and accurate responses to our questions, help us make decisions, and even keep us company. However, as we interact with these bots more and more, it's essential that we set boundaries around what we expect from them.

While we don't need to understand every detail about how a car works to trust it will get us to our destination, we do need to have some basic knowledge and understanding of its features and capabilities. Similarly, we should be aware of what information LLM AI chatbots are collecting and how they are using it. We should also recognize that these chatbots are not human and, therefore, have limitations.

Corporations developing LLM AI chatbots should also be responsible for setting boundaries around how the bots respond. There should be safeguards in place to ensure that the bots are not used for malicious purposes or to spread false information. Government regulators should also set boundaries regarding the "safety and effectiveness" of these bots to ensure that they are not causing harm.

In conclusion, we need to trust technology to some extent, but it's important to set boundaries around that trust. As we continue to use LLM AI chatbots in our daily lives, these boundaries will likely evolve, but we should always be aware of the limits of these technologies and the potential risks associated with their use. Ultimately, responsible use of technology will enable us to reap its benefits and live in a modern society that is both efficient and secure.
