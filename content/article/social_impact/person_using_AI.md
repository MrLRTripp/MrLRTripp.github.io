# AI won't take your job. A person using AI will.
AI chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT, Microsoft's Bing chatbot, and soon-to-be-released Google's Bard will disrupt knowledge worker jobs much like the internet and smartphone did before. No, some chatbot is not going to displace you and make your role unnecessary (at least not yet). The big concern for you **right now** is that someone else in your office, a competitor down the street, or a competitor on the other side of the world is moving at warp speed to use AI chatbots as a force multiplier.  

How big of a concern is this? Think about it this way. If you didn't have access to the internet but your competitor did, you would be put at an **extreme disadvantage**. A modern knowledge worker cannot function without the internet. You would quickly become obsolete and unnecessary. Not maximizing the *appropriate* use of AI chatbots when your competitors are could put you at an even **more extreme disadvantage**. This is because the AI chatbots have been trained using vast quantities of data available on the internet and can compose well-written responses based on prompts. You don't have to manually perform the searching and reading of many websites and composing a result; an AI chatbot can do it in seconds.

## Bottom line  
Don't let your competitors eat your lunch. Use your valuable time wisely and not waste it on tasks that can largely be automated.
