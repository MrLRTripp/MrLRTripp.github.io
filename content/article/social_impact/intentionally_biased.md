The rise of chatbots has revolutionized the way we interact with technology. With the advancements in natural language processing, chatbots have become more human-like in their responses, making them an attractive tool for businesses and organizations to communicate with customers. However, there is a new development in the world of chatbots that has raised concerns: intentionally biased chatbots.

The concern is not about the AI chatbots that are deliberately designed by nefarious actors to spread misinformation and propaganda - although they will surely use AI to supercharge their current bots. The concern is about the common chatbots that cater to specific viewpoints.

Just like there are conservative and liberal news sources, chatbots are being trained to respond with a bias. These chatbots are designed to reinforce certain beliefs or opinions and influence the user's thinking. For example, a chatbot could be biased towards a particular political party or ideology, leading users to believe in certain ideas and disregard opposing viewpoints.

The creation of intentionally biased chatbots raises ethical concerns about the impact of such technology on society. The use of biased chatbots can further polarize people and reinforce echo chambers, where individuals only interact with those who share their views. This can lead to a breakdown in communication and understanding between people with different beliefs.

As technology continues to advance, it is essential to consider the impact of intentionally biased chatbots on society. It is crucial to establish guidelines and regulations for the development and use of chatbots to ensure they are used ethically and for the benefit of society as a whole. As individuals, we must be aware of the potential biases of chatbots and critically evaluate the information we receive from them.
