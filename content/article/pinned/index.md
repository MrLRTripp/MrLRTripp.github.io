# Renewed public interest in AI
Ever since [OpenAI](https://openai.com) made ChatGPT and DALL-E 2 available to the public in
late 2022, there has been a renewed interest in Artificial Intelligence.  

ChatGPT is a text generator that can converse with humans on various topics, using natural language and common sense. It is based on GPT-3, one of the largest and most powerful language models ever created. ChatGPT can answer questions, tell jokes, write stories, and even generate code or lyrics.

DALL-E 2 is an image generator that can create realistic and creative images based on text prompts from users. DALL-E 2 uses a diffusion model, which generates images by gradually refining them from noise. The images on this site were generated using a combination of DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion and Midjourney.

However, along with great potential they also demonstrate the limitations of deep learning models. They also raise ethical and social questions about the impact of AI on human creativity, communication, and culture.

# Harness the potential  
Tech giants such as Microsoft, Google and Meta have all responded to this renewed interest and are releasing products to harness the potential of AI. Microsoft, which is a big investor in OpenAI, has been especially aggressive in its plans to enhance Bing search and Office products with natural language features similar to ChatGPT. The widely-held view is that the proven benefits of Large Language Models (LLMs) outweighs the limitations and social impact. However, this is only true if the users are educated on how to use these tools effectively.

# Education and practice
These powerful LLMs are like any other tool - education and practice will make you a better user of the tool. The widespread use LLMs is relatively recent so there are no definitive guidelines available that cover all the ways they can be used. It may not even be possible to write such a guideline given the vast and various ways that these tools can be used. They are also evolving at a tremendous rate to reduce their limitations and expand their applicability. Rather than take on the impossible task of exploring every aspect of these tools, let's focus on the practical uses of these tools.
