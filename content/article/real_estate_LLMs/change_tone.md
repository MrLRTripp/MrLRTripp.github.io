# Change the tone
AI chatbots like ChatGPT and Bing make it simple to change the tone of your message. Recall that the tone of a message is the attitude that a writer expresses towards a subject or topic to their reader. It can be delivered in different ways, such as through word choice, punctuation, and sentence structure. Tone always sends a message and it affects how the reader will perceive it.  

There are many types of tones that can be used in communication, such as formal, informal, factual, directive, assertive, friendly, questioning and conversational. The tone you choose depends on your purpose and audience. 

# Cold-call tone changes
Let's use Bing to change the tone of a message you are all familiar with: The cold-call note.

Here is the original prompt and response from Bing, followed by simple follow-up prompts to change the tone.
> I'm a real estate agent, Jane Doe. My phone number is (310) 555-1212. Write a short cold-call note that I can mail to homeowners in my area to persuade them call me. The value of their home may have gone up enough to convince them to sell.

## Confident tone

## Humorous tone
I don't recommend a humorous tone for a cold-call, but it is interesting to see how the wording changes.

# You can also change target audience
The best message is one that speaks to the needs of your target audience.
