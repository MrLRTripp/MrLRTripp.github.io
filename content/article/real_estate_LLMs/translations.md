# Translate your message to 100 languages  
The previous post showed how you can generate some very nice thank-you notes as long as you use a detailed prompt. You also saw how the AI chatbot can remember context so you can adjust a previous response by creating a new prompt with just the changes you want. For instance, let's translate the thank-you note to Spanish.  

Here is the thank-you note in English this time generated by ChatGPT:

After reviewing it, translate it to Spanish with a simple prompt:  
"Translate the thank-you note you just generated into Spanish."

A **super simple** way to reach out to your customers in the language they prefer.

# Change the tone of the message
That's not all. It is simple to change the tone of a message to a more friendly or more serious / legal tone with a simple prompt.  

We'll see an example in an upcoming post. Follow me so you don't miss it!
