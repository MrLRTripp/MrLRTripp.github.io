# AI chatbot streamlines creating a listing

In the world of real estate, time is money. The faster you can get a listing up and running, the better. This is where AI chatbots like Bing and ChatGPT come in handy. These powerful tools are capable of quickly creating real estate listings with minimal human input, saving time and money for all involved.

One of the key advantages of AI chatbots is their ability to gather and analyze data from multiple sources. For example, they can scan property data from public records, MLS listings, and other online sources to quickly compile a comprehensive list of features and amenities for a given property. They can also use machine learning algorithms to automatically identify and categorize key details, such as the number of bedrooms, square footage, and property type.
They can then use this information to create high-quality content that showcases the best aspects of any property.

In addition, AI chatbots can leverage natural language processing (NLP) to communicate with users in a conversational way. This means that you can quickly make adjustments to the listing with follow-up prompts to highlight features you think will catch a potential buyer's attention.

Overall, AI chatbots are a powerful tool for quickly creating real estate listings that are tailored to the needs and preferences of buyers and sellers. If you're a busy agent looking to streamline your workflow, AI chatbots are definitely worth considering. 
However, as with other types of responses, you have to review the listing to make sure that it is accurate and targets your potential buyers.

# Example using Bing  

I asked ChatGPT and Bing to generate listings for a home currently for sale: [28331 Pontevedra Dr, Rancho Palos Verdes, CA 90275 | MLS #SB23037512 | Zillow](https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/28331-Pontevedra-Dr-Rancho-Palos-Verdes-CA-90275/21345972_zpid/).

**Grade B**. Using the Bing chatbot Creative Mode option, it produced a nicely written, factual listing with links to sources. Bing's ability to search the internet for current information is very powerful.

# Example using ChatGPT

**Grade F**. ChatGPT's training data is frozen back in 2021. It also cannot search the internet. The result is that it **hallucinated** a listing based on some information it found about the property and general information it has about Rancho Palos Verdes.

# Summary  

Bing chatbot in Creative Mode creates a reasonably good listing in seconds that can be manually polished.  

Avoid ChatGPT when generating lisings since it doesn't have access to current information and will likely hallucinate a well written but false listing.
