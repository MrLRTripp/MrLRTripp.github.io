# Self-assessment
Before I begin to experiment with engineering prompts for specific tasks, let's have ChatGPT perform a self-assessment of its capabilities in the areas of Real Estate Analytics, Mortgages, and helping Real Estate Agents. After all, a good performance assessment of a human team member begins with a self-assessment.  

I think the response is pretty compelling, but we need to verify its capabilities with specifically engineered prompts and chat sessions.  

Follow along so you don't miss a thing!
