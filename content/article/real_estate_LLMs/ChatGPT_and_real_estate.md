# Focus on real estate and finance
[OpenAI](https://OpenAI.com/)'s ChatGPT requires no introduction. A surge of activity has occurred in technical forums, mainstream news sites, and social media platforms. Rather than repeating the broad capabilities of ChatGPT, let's take a closer look at how AI tools such as ChatGPT may be utilized for Real Estate Analytics, Mortgages, and helping Real Estate Agents. Why real estate and finance? These are huge industries that impact the daily lives of just about everyone and often require a personal touch. Let's learn how Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT  can benefit the professionals that work in these industries as well as the consumers. We'll also learn about some of the limitations of these tools so they are not used for tasks that they cannot currently perform.  
# Can't live with it
Even in the short time since ChatGPT has been in wide release, there have been numerous articles and discussions about the impact such powerful LLMs will have on society. While there is certainly some debate on the magnitude of the impact, there is no doubt that there will be a technological disruption that we have to adjust to or else be left behind. There is a continuous drive for higher efficiency and lower cost, so, as the saying goes, "If it can be automated, it will be automated." LLMs open up the possibility of automating many tasks that were out of reach or too costly. If you are performing these tasks as part of your role, then you must adapt and move into a new role. 

# Can't live without it  
Early adopters who have taken the time to learn about and practice using ChatGPT are already benefiting from its ability to provide answers and data with human-like writing patterns. ChatGPT can be used as a work force multiplier by enhancing customer engagement, automating repetitive tasks, generating high-quality content for messages, and providing personalization. As these AI-enhanced tools evolve and get better over time, the early adopters will accelerate past those who hesitate.
