# Sunset of the California coastal cities?
One big advantage that the Bing chatbot has over the more well known ChatGPT is that it can search the internet for current information. ChatGPT is not connected to the internet and has limited knowledge past 2021. This is very likely to change as OpenAI determines the best way to get current information into ChatGPT in a responsible way that doesn't break their Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) model that is able to generate such good responses.  

Let's test the Bing chatbot to analyze housing trends in California for the year 2022. The response is quite good and generated in a matter of seconds. How long would it take you to search for the data and summarize it?  

Since the response correctly stated the movement from larger coastal cities to smaller inland cities, the second prompt asked it to identify the top 5 inland cities with the most growth. The response was nicely formatted into a table with no specific prompting showcasing its ability to present data in a way that is easy to understand.  

2023 will be another year of big changes in housing market. Since the COVID-19 pandemic is continuing to fade and employers will require some workers to return to the office at least part-time, it is not yet time to sunset the big coastal cities.
