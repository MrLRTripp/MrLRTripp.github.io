# Create targeted messages with a simple prompt
If you have been following my blog, you know that AI chatbots such as ChatGPT and Bing remember the context of the chat session so making adjustments to the response from the chatbot is easy as following up with a simple prompt. As you well know, creating messages that are aimed at a specific target audience is important because it can increase customer engagement, revenue, loyalty, and satisfaction. It can also help you communicate your value proposition, address your audienceâ€™s pain points, and persuade them to take action. **AI chatbots can help to relieve the burden of creating variations of your main message in seconds!**  

# Example variations using ChatGPT
Let's see some examples of how ChatGPT can change the message based on the target audience.

First, the base message:  
The target audience has owned home for minimum of 15 years and age range is 45 - 55. Not likely to have children in school K-12.
