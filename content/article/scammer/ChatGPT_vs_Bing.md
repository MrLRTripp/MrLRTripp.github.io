# Who does it better?
Microsoft has a preview version of Bing that just got a lot smarter with its own version of ChatGPT. Now you can chat with Bing and get answers in natural language. Let's compare how Bing and OpenAI's ChatGPT performed when revising a scammer's text.  
Both revisions are much better than the original, but I prefer the ChatGPT revision; it uses a friendlier tone.   
This is an actual text message (without the link):
>Your Amazon Account on hold due to a billing issue. Unfortunately, W͏‌e͏ had t͏‌o͏ disable your A͏͏m͏͏‌a͏͏‌z͏͏o͏͏n͏͏ account.  
>Re͏͏c͏͏‌o͏͏‌v͏͏e͏͏r͏͏y͏͏ y͏͏‌o͏͏‌u͏͏r͏͏ a͏͏c͏͏c͏͏‌o͏͏u͏͏‌n͏͏t͏͏ i͏͏‌m͏͏m͏͏e͏͏d͏͏‌i͏͏a͏͏‌t͏͏e͏͏l͏͏y͏͏ c͏͏‌l͏͏i͏͏‌c͏͏k͏͏ l͏͏i͏͏‌n͏͏k͏͏ b͏͏‌e͏͏l͏͏‌l͏͏o͏͏w͏͏:
