# Improving scammers' text messages
As with many powerful tools, ChatGPT can be used for illicit purposes. In this case, ChatGPT can be used to correct grammar, punctuation and misspellings in a scammer's text message and rephrase it to read as if it came from a legitimate source. As we have been taught, poor grammar, punctuation and misspellings are often clues that a text message did not come from a legitimate source. But what happens if these clues are removed by ChatGPT?
