# Improving scammers' text messages
As with many powerful tools, ChatGPT can be used for illicit purposes. In this case, ChatGPT can be used to correct grammar, punctuation and misspellings in a scammer's text message and rephrase it to read as if it came from a legitimate source. As we have been taught, poor grammar, punctuation and misspellings are often clues that a text message did not come from a legitimate source. But what happens if these clues are removed by ChatGPT? For most savvy users, there will be other clues to flag it as a scam, but my concern is that there are already people falling for these scams so there may be an incremental increase in victims if the texts read as if they came from legitimate sources.
