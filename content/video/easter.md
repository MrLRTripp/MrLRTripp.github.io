# Easter Day frequency distribution chart  

Easter Day is a movable feast that can fall on any date between March 22 and April 25. It depends on the lunar cycle and the spring equinox. I was curious to see how the distribution of Easter Days has changed over time, so I used data from the Census Bureau to plot it with Matplotlib.

To make it more fun and engaging, I decided to animate the plot and show how the distribution evolves as the years go by. I also used pastel colors that remind me of Easter eggs and spring flowers. To create a custom color map, I de-saturated the rainbow color map from Matplotlib.

As a finishing touch, I added an Easter basket image that I generated with Bing text-to-image diffusion generator. It's a new feature that can create realistic images from text descriptions. I edited the image with Gimp to remove the background and adjust the aspect ratio.

I also used Bing chatbot as an assistant to help me with some of the coding challenges. It was very helpful in providing examples and tips for using Matplotlib functions. For example, it showed me how to use plt.figimage() to add the Easter basket image to the plot.
